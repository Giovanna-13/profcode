        <p>Música pode ser uma ótima ferramenta de concentração. Aqui estão algumas músicas que eu recomendo para a sua playlist de estudos/programar.</p>

        <h2>She Had the World (Alternate Version)</h2>
        <h3>Por: Panic! At the Disco</h3> <img src="img/patd.jpg" alt="Panic! At the Disco" width="200px">
        <audio src="audio/patd.mp3" controls="controls"></audio>
        <p>
            She held the world upon a string<br>
            But she didn't ever hold me<br>
            Spun the stars on her fingernails<br>
            But it never made her happy<br>
            Cause she couldn't ever have me<br>
            She said she won the world at a carnival<br>
            But she couldn't ever win me<br>
            'Cause she couldn't ever catch me<br>
<br>
            I, I know why<br>
            Because when I look in her eyes<br>
            I just see the sky<br>
            When I look in her eyes<br>
            Well I, just see the sky<br>
<br>
            I don’t love you I'm just passing the time<br>
            You could love me if I knew how to lie<br>
            But who could love me?<br>
            I am out of my mind<br>
            Throw an old line out to sea<br>
            To see if I can catch a dream<br>
<br>
            The sun was always in her eyes<br>
            She didn't even see me<br>
            But that girl had so much love<br>
            She'd wanna kiss you all the time<br>
            Yeah, she'd wanna kiss you all the time<br>
            She said she won the world at a carnival<br>
            But I'm sure it didn’t ruin her<br>
            Just made her more interesting<br>
            I'm sure it didn’t ruin her<br>
            Just made her more interesting<br>
<br>
            I, I know why<br>
            Because when I look in her eyes<br>
            I just see the sky<br>
            When I look in her eyes<br>
            Well I, I just see the sky<br>
<br>
            I don’t love you I'm just passing the time<br>
            You could love me if I knew how to lie<br>
            But who could love me?<br>
            I am out of my mind<br>

        <h2>Window</h2>
        <h3>Por: Joji</h3> <img src="img/joji.jpg" alt="Joji" width="200px">
        <audio src="audio/window.mp3" controls="controls"></audio>
        <p>
            I see nothing out the window, window<br>
            Nothing out the window<br>
            Watching all the leaves grow, leaves grow<br>
            Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though<br>
<br>
            And the sun will shine, no more<br>
            The sun will shine (Antidote), no more<br>
            I've been holdin' on too long<br>
            Holdin' on too<br>
<br>
            I know when the wind blows, wind blows<br>
            Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though<br>
            I just wanna sleep forever<br>
            Please just let me leave, forever<br>
<br>
            I don't need an antidote, antidote<br>
            I don't need an antidote, antidote<br>
            I don't need an antidote, forever<br>
            (Forever, forever)<br>
<br>
            We don't wanna drive slow, drive slow<br>
            Speed up with our eyes closed, eyes closed<br>
<br>
            Eyes closed, eyes closed<br>
            Head down, eyes closed<br>
            Ice cold, meltdown<br>
        </p>

            Calling the world from isolation<br>
            'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be <br>chained<br>
            And if you're coming back to find me<br>
            You'd better have good aim<br>
<br>
            Shoot it true, I need you in the picture<br>
            That's why I'm calling you<br>
<br>
            (Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand<br>
            Reset myself and get back on track<br>
            I don't want this isolation<br>
            See the state I'm in now?<br>

            If I pick it up when I know that it's broken<br>
            Do I put it back?<br>

            And let you down?<br>
